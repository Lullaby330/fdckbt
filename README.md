`Collect feedbacks`<br>

When a user sent a feedback, it will send to the channels that added on `bot.py`. There are two channels added in `bot.py` to get 
logs and feedbacks in default. You can add or remove those as your need but you MUST put credits for this repository in your `README.md`. When you are adding or removing those you must edit `config.py`, `bot.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `app.json`. else you will generate errors. for those don't tag admin. It should fix by yourself.<br>

This feature is not for anything but to enjoy. users can enjoy this by completing captcha. You can use `/captcha` command in this bot to prove yourself that you are a human. 

`Inline Bot list`

Using Inline mode, you can get the all the bot projects of me by using ```@sanilaassistant_bot``` in any chat. Very easy to share and get the bot repositories and the bot links.
